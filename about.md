# Foundations of Blockchain

## Book Description 

Bitcoin has hogged the headlines for a long time and blockchain, which is he underlying technology of Bitcoin was described by Fortune as something that will change everything. But after the hype, there is a lot of technical work to be done, and developers in particular need to understand in some depth what foundations they are actually building their project on. 

There is quite a bit of cryptography which we have to understand, and the general security in P2P networking demands of blockchain, before diving into the first blockchain project. All these concepts are explained by building simple applications from scratch. Cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications (DApps) are extremely popular, but not well understood technically, which is why Koshik Raj is presenting two of the core chapters of the book dedicated to both topics by covering the fundamentals along with implementations. 

Koshik Raj then compares the blockchain application categories, which helps to get acquainted with the various blockchain implementations, followed by a couple of chapters addressing the scalability and security concerns in the blockchain technology.  

Finally, Koshik Raj shows us how to branch out into new territory, and which rules and observations to take into account to select a true use case to build blockchain applications. 

## Key Features 

* Explains all networking and cryptography inherent in blockchain by creating simple applications 

* Talks about the theory as well as the nuts and bolts of cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications (DApps) 

* Addresses several security and scalability concerns in the blockchain applications 

* Leads to the frontiers of blockchain extensions and new application areas by identifying and exploring several use cases 
 

## What you will learn? 

* The role of cryptographic primitives and distributed computing in blockchain 

* Understanding the basics of blockchain, transactions and decentralization in cryptocurrency 

* Architecting and implementing decentralized applications (DApps) using blockchain platforms such as MultiChain, NEO and Ethereum 

* Analyzing and addressing the scalability and security concerns of blockchain applications 

* Introduction to few of the exciting topics such as sharding, zk-SNARKS, off-chain transactions and cross-chain protocols. 

* Depth comparison of blockchain application categories and how to choose a blockchain use case 

## Who this book is for? 

This book is designed for anyone who is looking to dive into the blockchain technology space. Although this book builds a foundation for blockchain technology for beginners, it can also be used by blockchain developers as a quick reference guide and also to gain deeper insights on few of the exciting topics in the blockchain technology.  

Although the book doesn’t assume readers expertise on any particular domain, a hands-on python programming, and theoretical networking knowledge, would speed up the reading process.
